# Facade Project
Semester Project at Swiss Data Science Center @EPFL

## Description
This project is part of collaboration between civil engineers and the Swiss Data Science Center (SDSC). Its goal is to help civil engineers automating the process of evaluat- ing the damage on a building after an earthquake occurred.
